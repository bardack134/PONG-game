# Pong Game

## Description
This Python script implements the classic Pong game using the Turtle module for graphics. It simulates a two-player game where each player controls a paddle to hit the ball. The objective is to prevent the ball from reaching the player's side while trying to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The game features paddle movement controls, ball physics, score tracking, and a win condition.
